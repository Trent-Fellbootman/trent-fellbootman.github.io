        "In the era of ChatGPT and GPT-4, proper usage of AIs influences their capabilities
        even more than their weights."

<h2>Overview</h2>

<div>
    <p>
        This blog introduces automated prompting, a new paradigm of utilizing AIs. Basically,
        this blog discusses how to use modern AIs to do virtually anything, efficiently and reliably.
    </p>

    <p>The blog is divided into 4 parts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Overview</strong> (current section)</li>
        <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Introduces the basics of deep learning and prompting.
            You are <strong>recommended to skip this section</strong> if you already know what deep learning is.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Prompting and Deep Intelligent Systems</strong>:
            Introduces the concepts and explains what these terms mean.</li>
        <li><strong>Designing Deep Intelligent Systems</strong>: Explains general guidelines for building
            capable and reliable AI systems with examples.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    Until not very long ago, deep learning development has been a 4-step process:
    design a model, train the model, evaluate the model, and deploy the model.
    Researchers and engineers have made tremendous efforts in improving the architectures
    of deep learning models and finding efficient ways to obtain high-performance weights
    with minimum computation and data. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
    such as ChatGPT, however, another aspect in AI is becoming increasingly important:
    prompting.
</p>

<p>
    The very idea of prompting has been around for a while, and there is even a term for
    the process of designing good prompts: "prompt engineering". However, there have been no serious,
    systematic research into the topic until this blog, and the "state of the art" of prompting have remained
    quite primitive: you design a good prompt, feed it to a model, and you are done.
</p>

<p>
    This is going to change. In this blog, I will introduce the concepts of automated prompting and
    deep Intelligent systems, as well the general guidelines for designing such systems. These discussions
    transforms prompting from an art to a science, and open ups a way to boost the capabilities of AI
    in a dimension that has never been explored before.
</p>

<h2>Automated Prompting and Deep Intelligent Systems</h2>

<p>
    Simply put, <strong>automated prompting</strong> is letting AIs to talk to other AIs, and a <strong>deep intelligent
    system</strong> is a system formed by a group of AIs who (yep, "who", not "which") use automated prompting to communicate and collaborate
    to achieve a certain goal, possibly using non-AI resources and tools as well, including Python interpreters, databases, web browsers,
    humans, etc.

    <h3>Example: Automated Prompting</h3>

    <p>
        If you have two iPhones, you can open up Siri on both of them and let the two Siris talk to each other.
        This is a simple example of automated prompting, although it not very useful. In this example, the output
        of one Siri (which is <strong><em>"automatically"</em></strong> generated) is used as input
        (the <strong><em>"prompt"</em></strong>) to the other Siri. For this, letting two Siris talk to each
        other is considered <strong><em>"automated prompting"</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Example: Deep Intelligent System</h3>

    <p>
        Suppose you need to create a video about some famous animals in Australia. You can achieve this goal with the
        following plan:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Use New Bing to find some of the most famous animals in Australia.
        </li>
        <li>
            For each of the animals, use Gen-1 (a model that generates video from text) to generate
            a video about the animal, use ChatGPT to generate a script introducing the animal, and use
            a voice synthesis model (a model that generates speech from text) to generate a speech for the script.
        </li>
        <li>
            Merge the videos, speeches together and make subtitles with scripts.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This is a basic deep intelligent systems, consisting of multiple intelligent agents such as New Bing, Gen-1 and voice synthesis models. The intelligent agents talk to each other: New Bing talks with Gen-1, telling it what prompt to use to generate the video, and with ChatGPT, telling it what the script it generates should be about.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        However, such an intelligent system is not fully autonomous, as you, the human, still need to act as the planner who creates the high-level plan, as well as the mediator, helping the intelligent agents to talk with each other (e.g., by copying what New Bing returns and pasting it to Gen-1 and ChatGPT). In the next sections, I will show you how to make this process fully autonomous: that is, tell the system that you need to "create a video about some famous animals in Australia", and let the AIs handle the rest.
